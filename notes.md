- This paper provides a method to calculate the misalignment of the VCS w.r.t the CCS. See Algorithm 3.

  * uses the forwards and lateral vanishing points (LVP) (FVP)
  * compares to manual calibration as ground truth
  * The angles derived by SmartDashCam have errors less than 7 degrees. This is high!
